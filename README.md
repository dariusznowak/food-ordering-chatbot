# Food Ordering Assistant project
## Features
Talk to the intelligent assistant and make orders for food you want.
Create your own tasks and manage them. You can use buttons or you can drag the tasks between taskboards using your mouse. Your tasks will be saved in your browser's memory so you can check them out any time you want to.

## Development
This app was created using **React.js** library.<br>
It's fully resposive which I managed to achieve by using **CSS Grid** and **CSS Flexbox** modules.<br>
To make created tasks remain after the web app reloads I used web browser's **local storage**.<br>
Drag and drop feature was developed using **react-dnd** package.
